# Space too late. Run the command you wanted to run but you hit the space bar one
# character too late
#
# Usage:
#   ln -s space-too-late gitp
#   gitp ush
#   gitc ommit
#
# Unlike its counterpart, space too soon, this one must be named differently based
# on which misspelling you frequently have

MISSPELLED=$(basename $0)
LETTER=${MISSPELLED: -1}    # Space before '-1' is important!
COMMAND=${MISSPELLED:0:${#MISSPELLED}-1}
echo "!!! Space too late! Executing: $COMMAND ${LETTER}$@"
exec $COMMAND ${LETTER}$@
